## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is a personal archive of all my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects — from basic practice files to complete frontend websites.  
It includes small experiments, course exercises, and **full-fledged static projects** I’ve built while learning frontend development.

> ⚠️ _Note: The structure may be raw and informal. Some files may be messy — it's all part of the journey._

## 🗂️ Heads Up

This is not a polished portfolio — it's a **real, honest, behind-the-scenes repo** showing how I learn, experiment, and build.  
Some files may be incomplete, repetitive, or buggy — and that’s completely okay.
